# Solving The N - Queens Problem

<strong>The Puzzle: </strong>

The 8-queens puzzle is a classic computer science problem which tries to find a possible arrangement of 8 queens on a standard 8 x 8 chessboard such that no queen is in an attacking state. Now, if one knows the basics of chess, one can say that a queen can travel either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Hence, for 2 or more queens to be in an attacking state, they have to lie either horizontally or vertically or diagonally in-line with the other queen and our task is to find a configuration that avoids that. 

The same problem can be generalized as N-Queens Problem where the number of queens can vary.
